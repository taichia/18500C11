<p>On Monday (3/6/2018) we received the Nordic NRF52 board that we ordered, which will act as the master for the Decawave sensor boards. I succeeded in setting up my local environment to develop for and program the NRF. I decided to choose Segger Embedded Studio as the IDE as it is cross-platform and thus can be used my all group members, as we use a mix of Windows/macOS/Linux. Using Nordic’s command-line tools and SDK, I successfully built a FreeRTOS Blink LED example project, erased flash on the NRF, and flashed the board. The NRF’s LEDs blinked as expected. Initial setup of board & environment is complete.</p>

<p>This week my responsibility was to prepare for development with the Decawave boards (DWM1001-DEV), so that we could get started once the boards arrived. I started by creating a Google Doc for Decawave related information. I compiled links to documents like the Datasheet, API guide, and Firmware User Guide. I read through some of the documents and set up the development environment for our boards. I downloaded a Linux VM with the Decawave firmware and necessary tools, and followed set-up instructions until the point where I needed the actual board to continue. </p>
